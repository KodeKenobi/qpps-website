				INVESTORS SHOULD REVIEW THE MEMORANDUM, INCLUDING THE RISK FACTORS AND

				Investments in the Fund are speculative and involve a high degree of
				risk, and therefore are only suitable for sophisticated investors for
				which an investment does not constitute a complete investment program
				and which fully understand and are willing to assume the risks involved
				in the Fund. The Fund may utilise leverage, which can make performance
				volatile. There is no secondary market for interests in the Fund and
				none is expected to develop. There are also restrictions on transferring
				interests and redeeming interests from the Fund. No guarantee or
				representation is made that the Fund’s investment program, including,
				without limitation, the Fund’s investment objectives, diversification
				strategies, or risk monitoring goals, will be successful, and investment
				results may vary substantially over time. Investment losses may occur
				from time to time. Nothing herein is intended to imply that the Fund’s
				investment methodology may be considered “conservative”, “safe”, “risk
				free” or “risk averse”. PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT INDICATIVE NOR A
				GUARANTEE OF FUTURE RESULTS. NO ASSURANCE CAN BE MADE THAT PROFITS WILL
				BE ACHIEVED OR THAT SUBSTANTIAL LOSSES WILL NOT BE INCURRED.

				Any financial indicators or benchmarks shown are for illustrative and/or
				comparative purposes only, may not be available for direct investment,
				are unmanaged, assume reinvestment of income, and have limitations when
				used for comparison or other purposes because they may have volatility,
				credit, or other material characteristics (such as number and types of
				securities or instruments) that are different from the Fund. A number of
				indices (each an “Index”) are referenced herein. Each Index is presented
				because Carrhae feels that it serves as a useful point of comparison
				with aspects of the Fund’s portfolio management and composition. The
				Fund’s portfolio will not replicate the Index and no guarantee is given
				that performance will match the Index; it is not possible to invest in
				any index. There are significant differences between the Fund’s
				investments and the Index. For instance, the Fund may use short sales
				and leverage and may invest in securities that have a greater degree of
				risk and volatility, as well as less liquidity, than those securities
				contained in the Index. Moreover, the Index is not subject to any of the
				management fees or expenses that the Fund must pay. It should not be
				assumed that the Fund will invest in any specific securities that
				comprise the Index, nor should it be understood to mean that there is a
				correlation between the Fund’s returns and the Index’s performance. The
				MSCI Emerging Markets and MSCI World Index is a market-capitalisation
				weighted index of the largest companies in Emerging Markets and Global
				Markets respectively. These are the most widely used index to benchmark
				active equity managers in Emerging Markets and Global Markets. For

				The net performance results set forth herein (i) represent the return of
				a hypothetical limited partner who invested in the Class A1 Share Class
				limited partnership interests of the Carrhae Capital Fund Ltd (i.e., the
				highest fee-paying class currently being offered by the Funds) on 12
				December 2011, unless otherwise specified, (ii) include the reinvestment
				of dividends, interest and other earnings, (iii) are calculated net of
				all expenses, management fees and incentive allocations, if any, that
				would apply to a full fee-paying limited partner invested in the Class
				A1 Share Class limited partnership interests of the Carrhae Capital Fund
				Ltd, (iv) assume that such hypothetical limited partner participates in
				the allocation of “new issues” as defined in Rule 5130 of FINRA, and (v)
				include all designated investments, if any. The gross performance
				results set forth herein (i) are a composite of the returns of all long
				and short assets of the Master Fund and do not represent the returns of
				any individual investor in the Funds, (ii) include the reinvestment of
				dividends, interest and other earnings, and (iii) are calculated net of
				all applicable investment-level expenses but gross of all applicable
				fund-level expenses, management fees and incentive allocations, if any,
				which, when deducted, will materially lower performance. An individual
				investor’s actual return may vary from the performance results presented
				above based upon, among other factors, the timing of investments and
				withdrawals/redemptions, differing fees/allocations and expenses, and an
				investor’s participation in, or exclusion from, certain investments,
				including new issues and designated investments. Because the Carrhae
				Capital Fund Ltd and Carrhae Capital Fund LP both invest through the
				Master Fund, the returns of the Carrhae Capital Fund Ltd are similar to
				the returns of the Carrhae Capital Fund LP, though differences may exist
				due to, among other factors, legal, regulatory and tax considerations,
				and differences in expenses and expense ratios. Results may not have
				been audited or realized and should not be relied upon as such. Past
				performance is not indicative of, and not a guarantee of, future
				results.

			<p>
				<strong>Risk Factors Summary</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				An investment in the Fund will entail substantial risks, including, but
				not limited to, those listed below, and a prospective investor should
				carefully consider the following summary of certain risk factors below
				and carefully consider the section of the Fund’s Confidential Private
				Placement Memorandum entitled “Certain Risk Factors,” in determining
				whether an investment in the Fund is suitable:
			</p>
			<p>
				Competition; Availability of Investment Strategies. The success of the
				Fund’s investment activities will depend on the Carrhae’s ability to
				identify investment opportunities as well as to assess the import of
				news and events that may affect the financial markets. Identification
				and exploitation of the investment strategies to be pursued by the Fund
				involves a high degree of uncertainty. No assurance can be given that
				Carrhae will be able to locate suitable investment opportunities in
				which to deploy all of the Fund’s assets or to exploit discrepancies in
				the securities and derivatives markets.
			</p>
			<p>
				No Material Limitation on Strategies. While it is Carrhae’s current
				intention to invest a substantial portion of the Fund’s assets in the
				strategies described in the Fund’s Confidential Private Placement
				Memorandum, the Fund will be permitted to opportunistically implement
				whatever strategies or discretionary approaches Carrhae believes from
				time to time may be best suited to prevailing market conditions. There
				can be no assurance that Carrhae will be successful in applying any
				strategy or discretionary approach to the Fund’s trading.
			</p>
			<p>
				General Risks of Investing in Securities. Any investment in securities
				carries certain market risks. An investment in the Fund is highly
				speculative and involves a high degree of risk due to the nature of the
				Fund’s investments and the investment strategies and trading strategies
				to be employed. An investment in the Fund should not in itself be
				considered a balanced investment program. Investors should be able to
				withstand the loss of their entire investment.
			</p>
			<p>
				All Investments in Securities Risk the Loss of Capital. No guarantee or
				representation is made that the Fund’s investment program will be
				successful. The investment program will involve, without limitation,
				risks associated with possible limited diversification, leverage,
				volatility, tracking risks in hedged positions, credit deterioration or
				default risks, systems risks and other risks inherent in the Fund’s
				activities. Certain investment techniques of the Fund can, in certain
				circumstances, magnify the impact of adverse market moves to which the
				Fund may be subject. In addition, the Fund’s investment in financial
				instruments may be materially affected by conditions in the financial
				markets and overall economic conditions occurring globally and in
				particular countries or markets where the Fund may invest its assets.
			</p>
			<p>
				Emerging Market Investments. The Fund may invest in securities of
				companies located in emerging countries or issued by the governments of
				such countries. Investing in such securities involves certain
				considerations not usually associated with investing in securities of
				companies located in developed countries or issued by the government of
				such countries, including security and economic considerations, such as
				greater risks of expropriation, confiscatory taxation, imposition of
				withholding or other taxes on dividends, interest, capital gains, other
				income or gross sale or disposition proceeds, limitations on the removal
				of funds, nationalization and general social, political and economic
				instability; the small size of the securities markets in such countries
				and the low volume of trading, resulting in potential lack of liquidity
				and in price volatility; fluctuations in the rate of exchange between
				currencies and costs associated with currency conversion; certain
				government policies that may restrict the Fund’s investment
				opportunities; and problems that may arise in connection with the
				clearance and settlement of trades. There is also less regulation,
				generally, of the securities markets in emerging countries than there is
				in more developed countries.
			</p>
			<p>
				Leverage and Borrowing. The use of leverage will allow the Fund to make
				additional investments, thereby increasing its exposure to assets, such
				that its total assets may be greater than its capital. However, leverage
				will also magnify the volatility of changes in the value of the Fund’s
				portfolio. The effect of the use of leverage by the Fund in a market
				that moves adversely to its investments could result in substantial
				losses to the Fund, which would be greater than if the Fund were not
				leveraged. Short-selling. Short-selling involves selling securities
				which are not owned by the short seller, and borrowing them for delivery
				to the purchaser, with an obligation to replace the borrowed securities
				at a later date. Short-selling allows the seller to profit from a
				decline in market price to the extent such decline exceeds the
				transaction costs and the costs of borrowing the securities. The extent
				to which the Fund engages in short sales will depend upon Carrhae’s
				investment strategy and opportunities. A short sale creates the risk of
				a theoretically unlimited loss, in that the price of the underlying
				security could theoretically increase without limit, thus increasing the
				cost to the Fund of buying those securities to cover the short position.
