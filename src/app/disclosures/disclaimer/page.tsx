          Our Publications and use of any Forward-Looking Statements
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        We may from time to time produce various communications (including but
        not limited to articles, publications, and commentary) that are
        classified as non-independent research. These materials are not prepared
        in accordance with legal requirements designed to promote the
        independence of investment research and are not subject to restrictions
        on dealing ahead of distribution.
      </p>
      <p>
        We define market commentary and insights as illustrative, educational
        notes that support or expand on previously published marketing
        materials. These communications qualify as minor non-monetary benefits
        (‘MNMBs’) under MiFID II (as transposed into UK law), meaning they are
        generic in nature and may be shared with any investment firm or the
        general public. They may also be delivered through events such as
        seminars or training sessions related to our investment products or
        services.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, content on the Website may include forward-looking
        statements (including but not limited to expectations or projections)
        based on our current views and assumptions. These are subject to known
        and unknown risks and uncertainties, and actual outcomes may differ
        materially from those expressed or implied.
      </p>
      <p>
        Words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,”
        “plan,” “should,” “will,” and similar expressions are used to identify
        such forward-looking statements. These statements reflect our views at
        the time they were made and are not guarantees of future performance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain, factors
        such as economic developments, market conditions, catastrophic events,
        or changes in capital markets may cause actual results to differ
        significantly. We make no representations, warranties or guarantees,
        whether express or implied, regarding the accuracy, completeness, or
        timeliness of these statements. We and our affiliates accept no

        <strong>Risk Notice</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Investments in all funds and hedge funds, including funds managed by us
        are speculative and involve a high degree of risk and are intended only
        for experienced and sophisticated investors. Investment in a fund may
        expose an investor to a significant risk of losing all of the property,
        capital or other assets invested. You therefore may lose some or all of
        the amount you choose to invest.
      </p>
      <p>
        Past performance is not and should not be seen as an indication of
        future results and as such it is not a reliable indicator of future
        results. Investments in funds all involve risk.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other factors are also to be considered prior to making an investment.
        Changes in exchange rates between the base currency and currency in
        which the investments are held may also cause the value of interests to
        decrease or increase. Tax assumptions may also change if the law changes
        and the tax treatment applicable to you will depend on your individual
        circumstances and may be subject to change in the future. You should
        consult your own tax adviser in order to understand the tax consequences
        of an investment in a fund or product.
      </p>
      <p>
        The risk factors set out above are not, are not intended to be, complete
        and you must refer to the relevant offering documents with respect to
        the risks attaching to investment in individual funds. The Website
        should not be relied upon as including sufficient information to support
        any investment decision.
      </p>
      <p>
        As further set out in these terms and conditions, all the opinions,
        forecasts, estimates and comparable information given on the Website are
        the non-binding opinions of our research personnel and neither we nor
        any of our officers and/or employees and affiliates makes any
        guarantees, representation or warranty, nor does any person accept any
        responsibility or liability for any loss or profit, indirect or other
        consequential losses or other economic losses suffered by any person
        arising from reliance upon any information, statement or opinion
        contained in the Website (whether such losses are caused by the
        negligence of such person or otherwise).
