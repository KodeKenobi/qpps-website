        <strong>Introduction</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) in the Prudential sourcebook for
        MiFID Investment Firms in the FCA Handbook (“MIFIDPRU”) sets out the
        detailed prudential requirements that apply to Carrhae Capital LLP
        (“Carrhae” or the “Firm”). Chapter 8 of MIFIDPRU (“MIFIDPRU 8”) sets out
        public disclosure rules and guidance with which the Firm must comply,
        further to those prudential requirements.
      </p>
      <p>
        Carrhae is classified under MIFIDPRU as a small and non-interconnected
        MIFIDPRU investment firm (“SNI MIFIDPRU Investment Firm”). As such, the
        Firm is required by MIFIDPRU 8 to disclose information regarding its
        remuneration policy and practices.
      </p>
      <p>
        The purpose of these disclosures is to give stakeholders and market
        participants an insight into the Firm’s culture and to assist
        stakeholders in making more informed decisions about their relationship
        with the Firm.
      </p>
      <p>
        This document has been prepared by Carrhae in accordance with the
        requirements of MIFIDPRU 8 and is verified by the Firm’s governing body
        (the “Executive Committee”). Unless otherwise stated, all figures are as
        at the Firm’s most recent March financial year-end.

      <p>
        <strong>Remuneration Policy and Practices</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Overview</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        In accordance with its MiFID top-up authorisation, it is categorised as
        a SNI MIFDPRU Investment Firm. Carrhae is subject to the basic
        requirements of the MIFIDPRU Remuneration Code (as laid down in Chapter
        19G of the Senior management arrangements, Systems and Controls
        sourcebook of the FCA Handbook (“SYSC”)). Carrhae, as an alternative
        investment fund manager, is also classified as a collective portfolio
        management investment firm, and as such, is also subject to the AIFM
        Remuneration Code (SYSC 19B). The purpose of the remuneration
        requirements is to:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-8">
        <li>
          Promote effective risk management in the long-term interests of the
          Firm and its clients;
        </li>
        <li>Ensure appropriate alignment between risk and reward;</li>
        <li>Support positive behaviours and healthy firm cultures; and</li>
        <li>
          Discourage behaviours that can lead to misconduct and poor customer
          outcomes.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The objective of Carrhae’s remuneration policies and practices is to
        establish, implement and maintain a culture that is consistent with, and
        promotes, sound and effective risk management and does not encourage
        risk-taking which is inconsistent with the risk profile of the Firm and
        the services that it provides to its clients.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, Carrhae recognises that remuneration is a key component in
        how the Firm attracts, motivates, and retains high quality staff and
        sustains consistently high levels of performance, productivity, and
        results. As such, the Firm’s remuneration philosophy is also grounded in
        the belief that its people are the most important asset and provide its
        greatest competitive advantage.
      </p>
      <p>
        Carrhae is committed to excellence, teamwork, ethical behaviour, and the
        pursuit of exceptional outcomes for its clients. From a remuneration
        perspective, this means that performance is determined through the
        assessment of various factors that relate to these values, and by making
        considered and informed decisions that reward effort, diligence, and
        results.
      </p>

        <strong>
          Characteristics of the Firm’s Remuneration Policy and Practices
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The Firm’s remuneration is comprised of fixed and variable remuneration.
        The sole component of remuneration that the Firm has categorised as
        fixed remuneration is base salary paid to employees. The components of
        remuneration described in the remainder of this paragraph are all
        categorised by the Firm as variable remuneration. The fixed and variable
        components of remuneration are appropriately balanced: the fixed
        component represents a sufficiently high proportion of the total
        remuneration to enable the operation of a fully flexible policy on
        variable remuneration. This allows for the possibility of paying no
        variable remuneration component, which the Firm may do should a need
        arise, such as where there is a risk that the Firm may not be able to
        meet its regulatory capital or liquidity requirements.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Firm’s sole bonus arrangement is fully discretionary. The Firm has
        discretion to pay bonuses to all staff based on the performance of the
        Firm as a whole, and the contribution of the individual to the success
        of the Firm. Carrhae’s Members are also eligible to participate in the
        net income of the GP via a shadow equity scheme.
      </p>
      <p>
        The objective of the Firm’s Remuneration Policy is to set remuneration
        at a level that the Firm’s staff are fairly and responsibly rewarded in
        a manner that is appropriately linked to their performance. The size of
        the bonus pool from which variable remuneration awards are made is
        assessed in light of the capitalisation and liquidity buffer in place at
        the Firm, taking into account current and future risks, drawing upon
        other available resources to make this assessment, such as the Firm’s
        Internal Capital Adequacy and Risk Assessment (“ICARA”).
      </p>
      <p>
        The Firm has a single business unit, that of Investment Management.
        Members’ and employee performance is determined using financial and
        non-financial criteria on a meritocratic basis which is completely
        gender neutral. This performance assessment is based on a range of
        criteria on which each Member and employee, when considering their job
        description, should be assessed. Individuals’ performance is not solely
        based upon investment performance or contribution; it also includes
        factors such as their adherence to the Firm’s compliance policies, the
        FCA’s Conduct Rules, risk limits and adherence to behavioural
        guidelines. Violations of these policies / risk limits, if any, will be
        taken into account when determining variable remuneration and can have a
        negative impact on the amount of variable remuneration received.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Governance and Oversight</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The Executive Committee is responsible for setting and overseeing the
        implementation of Carrhae’s remuneration policy and practices. In order
        to fulfil its responsibilities, the Executive Committee:-
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-8">
        <li>
          Is appropriately staffed to enable it to exercise competent and
          independent judgment on remuneration policies and practices and the
          incentives created for managing risk, capital and liquidity. The
          Compliance Officer, is a member of the Executive Committee and so can
          ensure that any relevant compliance and risk considerations are taken
          into account when setting individual remuneration awards;
        </li>
        <li>
          Prepares decisions regarding remuneration, including decisions that
          have implications for the risk and risk management of the Firm;
        </li>
        <li>
          Ensures that the Firm’s remuneration policy and practices take into
          account the public interest and the long-terms interests of
          shareholders, investors and other stakeholders in the Firm; and
        </li>
        <li>
          Ensures that the overall remuneration policy is consistent with the
          business strategy, objectives, values and interests of the Firm and of
          its clients.
        </li>
        <li>
          Carrhae’s remuneration policy and practices are reviewed annually by
          the Executive Committee.
        </li>
      </ul>
