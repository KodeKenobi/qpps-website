        <strong>Shareholder Rights Directive II (SRD II) Disclosure</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Under obligations arising from the revised Shareholder Rights Directive
        (EU 2017/828) (“SRD II”), a firm which trades shares on regulated and
        comparable markets, is required to either develop and publicly disclose
        an engagement policy as prescribed in COBS 2.2B.6R of the Financial
        Conduct Authority “FCA” Handbook, or disclose a clear and reasoned
        explanation of why it has chosen not to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Disclosure by Carrhae Capital LLP on SRD II</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Carrhae Capital LLP (“Carrhae” or the “Firm”) does not comply with the
        requirements of the Shareholder Rights Directive (“SRD II”).
      </p>
      <p>
        Carrhae invests predominantly in publicly listed companies operating in
        Emerging Markets. The Firm’s investment strategy and means employed in
        the execution of the strategy do not embrace significant engagement with
        investee companies, and the Firm does not consider that its clients
        expect such engagement. On that basis, whilst Carrhae generally supports
        the objectives of SRD II, it has decided not to adopt a separate
        engagement policy under SRD II as it does not consider it appropriate,
        or practicable, to adopt an approach solely relating to a specific
        region or jurisdiction.
