				Our Website (
				<Link href="https://www.carrhaecap.com">www.carrhaecap.com</Link>) uses
				&quot;cookies&quot; to distinguish you from other users of our Website
				and help you personalise your online experience. A cookie is a text file
				that is placed by us or our marketing partners on your browser or hard
				drive. Cookies are uniquely assigned to your computer and can only be
				read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to your
				computer.
			</p>
			<p>
				One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenient
				feature to save you time. The cookie tells the server that you have
				returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalise the Website
				pages, or register with the Website, a cookie helps the Website recall
				your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the
				process of recording your personal data, such as your billing address or
				site preferences. When you return to the Website, the information you
				previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the Website
				features that you customised.
			</p>
			<p>We may place or use the following cookies:</p>
			<ul className="list-disc pl-8">
				<li>
					<strong>Strictly necessary / essential cookies.</strong> These are
					cookies that are required for the operation of the Website. These
					essential cookies are always enabled because our Website will not work
					properly without them. They include, for example, cookies that enable
					you to log into secure areas of our Website.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Analytical or performance cookies.</strong> These allow us to
					recognise and count the number of visitors and to see how visitors
					move around the Website when they are using it. This helps us to
					improve the way our Website works, for example, by ensuring that users
					are finding what they are looking for easily.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Functionality cookies.</strong> These are used to recognise
					you when you return to the Website. This enables us to personalise our
					content for you, greet you by name and remember your preferences (for
					example, your choice of language or region).
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Targeting/Marketing cookies.</strong> These cookies record
					your visit to the Website, the pages you have visited and the links
					you have followed. We will use this information to make our Website
					more relevant to your interests and for marketing as described below.
					We may also share this information with third parties for this purpose
					so that they can serve you with relevant advertising on their
					websites.
				</li>
			</ul>

				If you want to check or change what types of cookies you accept, this
				can usually be done within your browser settings.
