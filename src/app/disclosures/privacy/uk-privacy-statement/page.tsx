        you are given an appropriate amount of information about how they use
        it. You also have various rights to seek information from those
        organisations about how they are using your data, and to prevent them

      </ul>
      <p className="underline">Special category data</p>
      <p>
        Certain types of personal data are categorised as sensitive and need
        more protection. For example: information about your race or ethnic
        origins, political opinions, sex life or sexual orientation, religious
        beliefs, health information, biometric and genetic data. There are also

        Collectively ‘special category personal data’.
      </p>
      <p>
        We do not systematically collect special category personal data and we
        will only process this type of personal data about you if we have a
        valid reason for doing so and only if the law allows us to do so. One
        example where we may collect special category personal data from you is
        where you from time to time share special category personal data with us
        in the form of identity document contents, or where this data is shared
        with us further to background checks that we are required to undertake.

        <strong>3. How is your personal data collected?</strong>
      </p>
      <p className="underline">Direct interactions with us</p>
      <p>
        When you use the Website or otherwise engage with us you are likely to
        provide a certain amount of personal data to us. We may collect, store
        and use any personal data about you that you provide, disclose or

      <p>
        This could be where you use the Website to upload or send personal data
        (by contacting us via our Website about our professional services,
        submitting applications for vacancies, or similar activities in which
        you volunteer data about yourself), contact us by post, telephone or
        email, if you report a problem with the Website, or if you engage with
        us as a prospective client or business contact. The personal data we
        collect from you may include Identity and Contact Data but will be
        limited to the precise details that you volunteer to us as you interact
        with us or the Website.

        we use it to ensure that the Website works properly, it is secure and
        that you are able to receive the full benefit of it. Second, we use the
        data to monitor online traffic and user participation across the Website
        which helps us to improve the Website’s functionality and optimise the
        ways that it operates. We undertake both of these activities because we

      <p className="underline">Lawful basis for processing your information</p>
      <p>
        We will only use your personal data when the law allows us to. Most
        commonly we will use your personal data in the following circumstances:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-8">
        <li>
          Where you have asked us to do so, or have otherwise consented to us
          doing so;

        <li>
          Where we need to do so in order to perform a contract we have entered
          into with you;
        </li>
        <li>
          Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a
          third party) and your fundamental rights do not override those
          interests; and
        </li>
        <li>Where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation.</li>
      </ul>

        Many of our communications will be administrative in nature but we may
        use your personal data to form a view on what we think may be of
        interest to you – including updates or services offered. This is how we
        decide which services and content may be relevant for you (we call this
        marketing).
      </p>
      <p>
        You will only receive marketing communications from us (such as e-mails)
        if you have requested information from us or purchased services from us
        or via the Website and you have not opted out of receiving such
        marketing at the time of purchase or engagement.
      </p>
      <p>
        This however differs from advertisements which you will see on the
        Website. All users of the Website will see advertisements on the
        Website, but the content of these adverts may differ depending on each
        user. As with the marketing communications described above, these
        adverts may be delivered to you based on analysis of your behaviour on
        the Website.
      </p>
      <p>
        Showing advertisements in this way is essential to the Website’s
        operation and viability. Please however be assured that we do not sell
        or otherwise disclose your personal data to advertisers directly, and
        individual advertisers are not made aware of which individual users have
        viewed their advertisements (unless you actively click on or otherwise
        engage with the advert in question).

      <p>
        Please note that should you ever ‘opt-out’ of receiving marketing
        messages you will continue to receive administrative messages from us

        another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose.
        This includes sharing personal data with successor businesses. If you

        <strong>5. For how long do we keep your personal data?</strong>

        We will hold your personal data on our systems only for as long as
        required to provide you with the services you have requested, including
        for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or
        reporting requirements or to perform the purpose for which that data was
        collected. We may retain your personal data for a longer period in the
        event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of
        litigation in respect to our relationship with you.
      </p>
      <p>
        To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we
        consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the
        potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your
        personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and
        whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the
        applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements.

      <p>
        By law we have to keep basic information about our customers (including
        contact, identity, financial and transaction Data) for six years after
        they cease being customers for legal, regulatory, compliance and
        insurance purposes. In some circumstances you can ask us to delete some
        or all of your data earlier: see ’
        <Link href="#your-rights">Your Rights</Link>’ below for further
        information, although this may not always be possible if we are obliged
        to retain the data for compliance and insurance purposes.

      <p>
        In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it
        can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical
        purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without
        further notice to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may also collect, use and share aggregated data such as statistical
        or demographic data for any purpose. Aggregated data could be derived
        from your personal data but is not considered personal data in law as
        this data will not directly or indirectly reveal your identity.

        mandatory statement which summarises certain law applicable in your

        personal data that we hold about you in order to enable you to check
        that it is correct and to ensure that we are processing that personal
        data lawfully. It is not a right that allows you to request personal
        data about other people, or a right to request specific documents from
        us that do not relate to your personal data.

        supplied us with is right. Further, we are not always obliged to erase
        personal data when asked to do so if, for example, we have an ongoing
        legal obligation or need to continue processing that personal data.

        and on what basis you are making that request. If you want us to replace

        interest (see the section of this Policy which explains how and why we
        use your information) you are entitled to ask us to stop processing it
        in that way if you feel that our continuing to do so impacts on your
        fundamental rights and freedoms or if you feel that those legitimate
        interests are not valid.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may also ask us to stop processing your personal data (a) if you
        dispute the accuracy of that personal data and want us verify that
        data&apos;s accuracy; (b) where it has been established that our use of
        the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where we no
        longer need to process your personal data (and would otherwise dispose
        of it) but you wish for us to continue storing it in order to enable you
        to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will comply with your request unless we have an ongoing legal
        obligation or need to continue processing personal data that you ask us
        to stop processing; a compelling overriding legitimate interest for such
        processing; or we need to continue processing your personal data to

        specific form to make this kind of request.
      </p>
      <p className="underline">Your Right to Portability</p>
      <p>
        Where you wish to transfer personal data that we hold about you, which
        is processed by automated means, to a third party you may write to us
        and ask us to provide it to you in a commonly used machine-readable

        your data to a third party we are happy to consider such requests.
      </p>
      <p className="underline">Your Right to object to processing</p>
      <p>
        You may object to processing of your personal data where we rely on
        legitimate interest for processing that personal data. We will comply
        with your request unless we have a compelling overriding legitimate
        interest for processing or we need to continue processing your personal
        data to establish, exercise or defend a legal claim.
      </p>
      <p className="underline">Your Right to Stop Receiving Communications</p>
      <p>
        Where we send you e-mail marketing communications (or other regulated

        do this by at any time by simply replying to the message with the text

        Your Right to Object to Automated Decision Making and Profiling
      </p>
      <p>
        You have the right to be informed about the existence of any automated
        decision making and profiling of your personal data, and where
        appropriate, be provided with meaningful information about the logic
        involved, as well as the significance and the envisaged consequences of
        such processing that affects you.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want more information about any automated decision making and
        profiling or to object to the same you can exercise this right at any
        time by <Link href="/?scrollTo=contact">writing to us</Link> and telling
        us that you are making such a request. You do not have to fill in a
        specific form to make this kind of request.

        Withdraw consent, where consent is the lawful basis for processing
      </p>
      <p>
        You have the right to withdraw consent at any time where we are relying
        on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect
        the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your
        consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide
        certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the
        case at the time you withdraw your consent.

        When you write to us making a request to exercise your rights we are
        entitled to ask you to prove that you are who you say you are. We may
        ask you to provide copies of relevant ID documents to help us to verify
        your identity.

        You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to
        exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable
        fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive.
        Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your request in these
        circumstances.
      </p>
      <p>
        We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month.
        Occasionally it could take us longer than a month if your request is
        particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this
        case, we will notify you and keep you updated.

      <p className="underline">Statutory Regulator</p>
      <p>
        If you are unhappy with the way that we have processed your data then
        you have the right to lodge a complaint with your local data and privacy
        regulator. If you wish to do so then you can write to them using their
        published contact details. We would however appreciate the chance to
        address your concerns before you approach the supervisory authority so
        please contact us in the first instance.

        If you are located in the UK then your local regulator is the
        Information Commissioner’s Office. If you are resident in the European
        Union then details of your local regulator are published by the European
        Data Protection Board.
